Whenever records are deleted from their respective table, the Auto Increment number will not reset.

To reset the auto increment number, use **truncate tablename; **this removes all the records and resets
the auto increment back to 1.

Step One: open phpMyAdmin, then open the desired table.
Step Two: navigate to: Operations -> Table Options.
Step Three: reset the **AUTO_INCREMENT **field to desired value.
Step Four: save.

Next time a new record is inserted, they will start from the auto increment number as set in Step Three.
