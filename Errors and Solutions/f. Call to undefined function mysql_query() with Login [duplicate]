It's possible you might be mixing mysql and mysqli.

This error is raised because mysql_* functions are completely removed from PHP 7, 
it previously got deprecated in PHP 5.5, but now it is completely removed.

Possible Solutions:

-Use MySQLi or PDO
-Connecting to Mysql with the Pdo Object Is Pretty Straight Forward
-Connecting to MySQL with MySqli Connection Object
-Rollback to Older PHP 5, update your code to mysqli or PDO and then upgrade to PHP7
