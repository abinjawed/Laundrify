Basically, the CDN links for the bootstraps, Data Tables and jQuery won't execute if the data 
is collected from a local host.

Solution / Workaround: 2 Options:

1) Download each bootstrap component and reference them internally as files in the htdocs directory, for example:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">

<script src="bootstrap/js/dataTables.bootstrap4.min.js"></script>

2) Forego the bootstrap components... instead, script the minimal table structures in the php files. 
It may not contain the fancy, responsive features, (column sorting - ascend/descend, filter, search bar, pages in increments of 10 rows),
but you will eliminate dependencies that behave differently on data stored on a hard drive vs local host or local storage.
