Basically, the CDN links for the bootstraps, Data Tables and jQuery won't execute if the data 
is collected from a local host.

Solution / Workaround: 2 Options:

1) Download each bootstrap component and reference them internally as files in the htdocs directory.

2) Forego the bootstrap components... instead, script the minimal table structures in the php files. 
It may not contain the fancy, responsive features, (column sorting - ascend/descend, filter, search bar, pages in increments of 10 rows),
but you will eliminate dependencies that behave differently on data stored on a hard drive vs local host or local storage.
